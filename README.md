# book_website
A basic structure of a book website.

I have used python with django framework to create this model website.

Created a signup page for users along with that also created a login page for users to login to the website where only registerd person can login.

Also created the home page connecting the Mysql database listing the stored data on the homepage from the database.

Also created a search machanism for finding the specific required books on the basis of Book name, category name or author name.
